## Challenges and Notes

### Challenges
- **UI Design**: Balancing aesthetics with performance in Jetpack Compose components.
- **State Management**: Managing data flows and UI updates within the **MVVM architecture** required careful implementation.

### Notes
- The app uses a third-party API for currency rates. Ensure your API key is active and has sufficient quota.
- Utilized MVVM architecture to maintain and read code easily.
- Caching is implemented with Room Database for offline use. Rates might be outdated if the app has been offline for an extended period.
